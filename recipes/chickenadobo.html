    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My Filipino mom taught me how to make tangy, savory chicken adobo, passing on to me the recipe her mother taught her. So naturally I thought hers was the one true way. Then I found out that everyone makes it a little differently, and everyone swears theirs is authentic. So now that I'm teaching my son how to make it, I'm curious to know who's right. Turns out we all are.</p>
    <p>Adobo is a cooking method rather than a specific recipe. Kind of like how barbeque in America is a cooking method with its passionate sauce-or-no-sauce supporters. The difference is, Filipinos politely acknowledge each other's adobo, <em>while secretly knowing their own recipe is the one true way</em>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cloves garlic crushed</li>
        <li>1 pc onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 kilogram chicken cut ups</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 pcs bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tsp whole black peppercorns, slightly crushed</li>
        <li>2 pc Knorr chicken cubes</li>
        <li>1 tsp brown sugar packed</li>
        <li>Option: 1 cup kale or spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in pan and saut√© garlic and onions. Then add chicken to the pan and sear on all sides, until you have a little browning in the chicken skin.</li>
        <li>Pour in vinegar, soy sauce and water. Add bay leaves, pepper and Knorr Chicken Cubes. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce heat to simmer, but do not cover the pan. Continue to simmer for 10 mins.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken pieces from sauce and fry in another pan until nicely browned.</li>
        <li>Put back fried chicken pieces into sauce. Add sugar and let simmer again for another 10 minutes or until sauce has thickened. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
